# Launch Tech Challenge

There are two pieces to this challenge:

1. A refactoring exercise (in the `refactoring` project)
1. An MVC exercise (in the `nearest-fuel-station` project)

Additional details on each are included below.

We recommend spending **no more than 3 hours** on this challenge.

In order to complete these challenges, clone (don't fork) this repository. Make your changes and commits in your cloned repository.

## Refactoring

The `refactoring` project includes a working CreditCard class that is able to determine whether or not a credit card number is valid using the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). There are NUnit tests included in the Refactoring.UnitTests project that confirm this functionality. While the existing code works, it does not demonstrate the best code construction or design.  

Refactor the CreditCard class - make **any** change you want, as long as the existing tests still pass. You _may_ add additional tests.

After you have refactored the CreditCard class, update this document with answers to the following questions:

* It's not uncommon that a student just learning to program would feel comfortable with the code as it was initially provided. Is the code that you created better than the previous version? Why or why not? How would you describe the advantages/disadvantages of your refactored code to a student who is still fairly new to programming?  
* Are there additional changes that you would make, if given more time?
